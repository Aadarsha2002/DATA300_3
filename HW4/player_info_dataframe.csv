Agarwal struck 432 runs at an average of 54 in five matches in the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy in 2008-09 and hit a match-winning 160 for India Under-19s, in a one-dayer against Australia Under-19s in Hobart in 2009.Agarwal was a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing Under-19 World Cup for India in 2010, top-scoring for his side in the tournament. Agarwal then graduated to the India A sides, but struggled for consistency.  Initially pigeonholed as a limited-overs specialist,  Agarwal made his Ranji Trophy debut for Karnataka in the 2013-14 season; he made his T20 debut in 2010-11 and List A debut in 2011-12. In the 2014-15 season, he was in the running to open for Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy, but was benched halfway through the season. According to Rahul Dravid, who worked with Agarwal in the India A side, it was a ""wake-up call"" for the opener. Agarwal lost weight in the off season, worked hard on his fitness, and scored his maiden first-class century the following season. He spent three seasons in the IPL with Royal Challengers Bangalore, from 2011 to 2013, scoring 492 runs in 35 matches, before moving to Delhi Daredevils in 2014. His stint with Daredevils was fairly muted in his first two seasons.ESPNcricinfo staffView more"

And it was that sharp brain, along with the carrom ball, an equally good arm ball, and masterly control over his offbreaks that made him a quintessential limited-overs spinner early in his career. It was in Test cricket, though, that he became a force after he brought the full scope of his talents to bear on it. His success was desperately needed by India in the time after Anil Kumble retired and Harbhajan Singh was on the wane. Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test, in which he was Player of the Match. In his first 16 Tests he collected nine five-fors, and he went on to be the fastest to 300 wickets and the second fastest to 400, behind only Muthiah Muralidaran.Among the highlights of Ashwin's Test career: 30 five-fors and counting, 90-odd wickets apiece against both Australia and England, and over 50 wickets a year four times. He reached his zenith in the 2016-17 home season, when he took 27 wickets in a three-Test series against New Zealand, 28 in five matches against England, six in a game against Bangladesh, and 21 against Australia in four Tests.Ashwin was picked by Chennai Super Kings in the IPL in 2009, and was one of the rare players who came into the public's reckoning through the IPL and proved himself good enough to have great success in Test cricket. He spent six seasons at CSK, winning the title twice, bowling at the top and the death, and coming on when wickets were required. He was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League in South Africa.He was part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but got few chances in that tournament ahead of Harbhajan. In the 2015 tournament, he made up with 13 wickets from eight games in India's run to the semi-final. In T20Is his finest hour was the World Cup in 2014, when he took 4 for 11 against Australia, and 11 wickets in all in the tournament, where India lost in the final.An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin has been a more than handy lower-order batter, correct, possessed of shots, and with five Test hundreds to his name.

Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him. Besides, like his Mumbai Indians team-mate, Lasith Malinga, Bumrah carved himself a reputation for possessing an uncanny ability to hit the blockhole. And, it was during his time in the IPL that he learned from the Sri Lankan to judiciously use the yorker.  A regular member of the India A team, Bumrah was on the fringes of national selection before a debilitating left knee injury at the end of 2014 kept him out for four-and-a-half months. He had to wait more than a year before earning another call-up, one which came on the back of a fruitful 2015-16 domestic season, where he was Gujarat's second-highest wicket-taker in the Ranji Trophy and topped the bowling charts in the Vijay Hazare Trophy - that included a five-for in the List-A final that gave Gujarat their maiden one-day title. Those performances, and an untimely injury to Mohammed Shami, meant Bumrah took the flight to Australia, where he played a central role for India, finishing as the highest wicket-taker from either side as the visitors swept the T20Is 3-0. It was a showing that earned him the praise of MS Dhoni - who called him the find of the tour - as well as a place in India's squad for the 2016 World T20.ESPNcricinfo staff View more"

A former chess player who represented India at junior levels, Chahal made his first-class debut for Haryana the same year and was signed by Mumbai Indians in 2011 to be part of their IPL squad. He didn't play a game that season but was still named in Mumbai's Champions League T20 squad the same year. It was in the Champions League that he got an extended run in the side - he featured in the playing XI in all the matches and starred in Mumbai's win in the final with a spell of 3-0-9-2. However, in the next two years with Mumbai, he managed only one game. His IPL fortunes mirrored those in domestic cricket, where he played in only eight matches in three seasons from 2011-12 onwards and picked up just 16 wickets.It was with Royal Challengers Bangalore, though, that he found the bulk of his success. He was their highest wicket-taker for two years running since the 2015 season and by virtue of that earned his first India caps in ODIs and T20Is on a tour of Zimbabwe in June 2016. While that series may have been seen as an opportunity to blood new players into international cricket, Chahal was called up again into the Indian T20 line-up to face England in January 2017, and delivered in style in the deciding game: his 6 for 25 in that match in Bangalore was part of an England collaspse of 8 for 8, and the third-best figures till then in T20Is.ESPNcricinfo staffView more"

After making a sensational first-class cricket debut for Rajasthan in 2010-11 - 8 for 10 in Hyderabad's score of 21 all out - Chahar struggled with injuries and fitness, which was probably the reason why Greg Chappell, director of cricket at Rajasthan, had turned him down two years previously. Chahar proceeded to rediscover himself as a T20 bowler, blossoming under the captaincy of MS Dhoni in Chennai Super Kings' triumphant return to IPL in 2018. A bowler in the mould of Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Chahar learnt swing bowling in the coaching academy of his father, who would make sure his son bowled only with the new ball despite the financial strain procuring so many new balls brought. Dhoni shrewdly used him with the new ball, often bowling three overs of his in the Powerplay, but Chahar kept working on his other skills and turned himself into a capable bowler at the death, which was evident in his world-record effort: four of his six wickets, including a hat-trick, came with a wet old ball in dewy conditions, against Bangladesh in November 2019.

That debut, in Mohali in 2012-13, came to Dhawan in his ninth year of first-class cricket after he had been written off by almost everybody, not least because India's opening combination had been fixed to the most prolific combination in their Test history: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.Dhawan is one in a long line of stroke-players from Delhi, which became the Indian batting capital in the 2000s. He stands upright in his stance, is a bit stiff with his hands when he pushes forward, and is partial to the cover-drive. Those who played domestic cricket with him say he is supremely confident, bordering on showmanship. He is also a flamboyant personality with his ever-changing looks and the twirled moustache.However, the attractive strokes, which were apparent even in the 2003-04 Under-19 World Cup where he was the Player of the Tournament for scoring 505 runs at 84.16 with three centuries, didn't seem to translate into huge seasons in Ranji Trophy. His average stayed steady in the mid-40s, but he didn't quite dare the selectors to overlook him. After lukewarm showing in the IPL and five ODIs, and with the Test openers going well, it seemed Dhawan would be left consigned to domestic cricket and T20 leagues.Fortune turned, though, and both Sehwag and Gambhir lost form dramatically, giving Dhawan a chance at the age of 27 with 81 caps and 5679 first-class runs to his name already. Dhawan grabbed the chance with arguably the best debut by an Indian batsman, smashing 187 off 174 balls to set up India's win in a Test that was reduced to four days. He was picked in India's squad for the Champions Trophy soon after, and carried his sizzling form into that tournament with two centuries in the side's first two matches.Dhawan's form later tailed off in England and Australia in 2014 but he hit back with 412 runs at 51.50 in India's run to the 2015 World Cup semi-finals.

The previous season the franchise had taken a punt on Gaikwad as one for the future, slotting him in as an anchoring opener who could attack when needed. They gave him six games and he showed what he was capable of, with over 200 runs. Towards the pointy end of the 2021 tournament, Gaikwad made 70 in the qualifier against Delhi Capitals and put on a partnership of 61 with Faf du Plessis in the final, taking CSK to 192, which turned out to be plenty. Fresh off that success, he captained Maharashtra in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament and made 259 runs.Gaikwad's first-class, List A and T20 debuts came in 2016-17, and he shone in the middle format, with 444 runs, the third highest in the Vijay Hazare Trophy that year.

A decade and a half since bursting onto the scene, Goswami, one of the fastest bowlers in the women's game till not too long ago, has reaped rewards through control and minute deviations off the pitch. In May, she surpassed Cathryn Fitzpatrick to become the highest wicket-taker in women's ODI history.  Now, she doubles up as a mentor to a young group of fast bowlers coming through the ranks in India.She was earmarked for a leadership role when she was named vice-captain of the national team ahead of the tour of England in 2006. There, she helped India to the Test series win, including their first victory against England, making a fifty as nightwatchman in the first Test at Leicester and taking her career-best match figures of 10 for 78 - 5 for 33 and 5 for 45 - in the second Test at Taunton. Such feats made her the Player of the Series and also brought recognition at the Castrol Awards in Mumbai in September, where she received a Special Award. Further to that, she won the ICC Women's Player of Year in 2007 - a year no Indian male player bagged any individual award. Soon after, she was elevated as captain of the national team.  Then in 2010, she was conferred with the prestigious Arjuna Award. A Padma Shri followed two years later.Bowling exploits aside, Goswami is a more-than-handy lower-order batsman. Goswami partnered Mithali Raj for a better part of her record-breaking 214 against England at Taunton in 2002. The pair added 157, with Goswami chipping in with 62. England was also the scene of India's one-off Test win in 2014, where Goswami triggered the hosts' slide with a four-wicket haul to set up the win. In 2015, she was one of four senior players who were handed the highest grade of central contracts by BCCI for the first time.

He made headlines when Delhi Daredevils bought him at the 2015 IPL auction for Rs 2.6 crore (about US$416,000). It was faith he repaid with interest: he made 439 runs that season, and won the IPL Emerging Player of the Year award. Over the next six seasons, he became a mainstay of the side and its captain, making over 400 runs a season for them four times. Iyer came up through the Under-19 ranks, hitting back-to-back fifties in the 2014 World Cup playoffs to help India finish fifth. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai the next domestic season, and after a lukewarm stint in the middle order, was promoted to opener and finished as the team's top run-getter with 809 runs at an average of over 50. He had a blow-out Ranji Trophy season the next year, with 1321 runs at 73, and made a century in the final, where Mumbai won their 41st title.By then calls for Iyer to be fast-tracked into the India side had grown clamorous, but it took nearly another two years before he made his international debut, in the white-ball formats first. His first hundred for India came in an ODI against New Zealand in Hamilton in 2020, and he made a century and fifty on Test debut against the same side a little over a year and a half later, this time at home. In a Ranchi ODI in October 2022, he made a chase of 282 against South Africa look like a walk in a park with a well-paced unbeaten 113 that took India home with plenty of room to spare.

Six years before that, he had became the first Indian since Anil Kumble in 1993 to top the ICC ODI bowling rankings. In the IPL, he drew a scarcely believable bid of US$2 million in 2012. In an era in which he was bound to be overshadowed by the artistry of fellow spinner R Ashwin, Jadeja kept his senior colleague on his toes, and often stole the spot when conditions allowed India to play just the one spinner. It helped that he was a captain's dream: arguably the fastest man on the turf and the best fielder in the time that he played, he went on to become an important lower-order batter. Some of his best batting performances came against the top teams, and they were often accompanied by the swordsman's celebration that became his signature. Ten years into his career, he had five Test fifties and a hundred against England - the latter in a partnership of 222 with Rishabh Pant at Edgbaston in 2022 - and four half-centuries against Australia. It was all a far cry from the memes his batting inspired at the start of his career - though the ridicule directed at his three triple-hundreds in domestic cricket back then was more an indictment of the quality of bowling on the Indian first-class circuit at the time. Jadeja shone in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win, finishing as the leading wicket-taker, with 12 wickets, two of those in the final, where he also made an unbeaten 33.His most valuable assets as a bowler are perhaps his fitness and strength, which enable him to go at batters for hours, ready to pounce on any assistance from the pitch. Like with his batting, his bowling highlights too feature the best sides disproportionately. His first Test five-for came against Australia in Delhi in 2013, and was followed by 6 for 138 in his next match, against South Africa in Durban, though that was in an India defeat. When South Africa next visited India, he got stuck into them, with 23 wickets in the four Tests in 2015. Against England at home in 2016-17, he harvested 26; this included an impressive demolition job in Chennai, where he took 7 for 48 after India had racked up 759 runs. Later that season he took 25 wickets when Australia visited for four Tests, to go with the 24 from the previous time, in 2013. Through the first half of his career and beyond, Jadeja's place in the Test side was never quite secure. He had to fight through a serious shoulder injury, and he was even dropped from the squad, but he kept coming back. Of course, these hardships paled in comparison with a tough childhood in Jamnagar, and the hard knocks that marked his early career, including being banned by the IPL for a year for essentially trying to negotiate his salary. In that tournament, Jadeja has been synonymous with Chennai Super Kings, for whom he has taken over 100 wickets over nine seasons and whom he briefly captained in 2022.

It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances. Karthik was still a giant in domestic cricket though, and had a knack for turning up on turning tracks. No doubt his penchant to sweep, reverse sweep and hare down that track at spinners helped his cause. Those quick feet have at times failed him behind the stumps - often at crucial junctures. He was recalled to the Indian side for a tour of Bangladesh in 2014 - but his wicketkeeping let him down.Karthik made over 1000 first-class runs in the 2008-09 season, with five centuries including a 213 as Tamil Nadu captain as they reached the semi-finals. For five seasons since - barring 2010-11, 2013 [when he played only one match] and 2015-16 - he had maintained a batting average above 40. Karthik found himself in contention again after Dhoni's retirement in 2014, but Wriddhiman Saha was preferred because he was seen as the stronger keeper.An in-and-out history with the Indian team didn't help. He was picked in the one-day squad, as replacement for Parthiv Patel in August 2004, and made his debut in a NatWest Challenge game against England where he pulled off a superb stumping. Shortly afterwards, he was called up to make his Test debut against Australia but when he could manage only one fifty in ten matches, he was axed.He made a comeback in 2008 - picked in the Indian side for all three formats for a tour of New Zealand - but his middling performances continued over the following year and did not allow him to cement a place in the team. He fell out of contention, until a fine 2012-13 domestic season got him back into the ODI side for the 2013 Champions Trophy in England but it proved to be another false dawn.Karthik may feel unfulfilled when he looks back on his international career, but the IPL should have helped soothe him. He was bought at INR 12.5 crore by Delhi Daredevils in the 2014 auction and the next year, he netted INR 10.5 crore courtesy Royal Challengers Bangalore. He was acquired by Gujarat Lions for INR 2.3 crore in 2016.ESPNcricinfo staff

She represents the new-age India women's cricketer, part of a generation that has been at the center of ad campaigns, endorsements and central contracts. She's a path-breaker too, having become the first India cricketer - male or female - to sign a Big Bash League contract with Sydney Thunder in Australia. The deal came about on the back of an impressive showing during India's tour of Australia in January 2016, where she made a 31-ball 46 to script India's highest-ever T20 chase. In June 2017, she became the first Indian to sign with Surrey Stars in ECB's Kia Super League.Harmanpreet broke through in 2009, but it wasn't until 2013 when she stamped her class. Her century against England at the World Cup, albeit in a losing cause, earned her plaudits from opposition captain Charlotte Edwards. Her career graph since has skyrocketed since.In April 2013, she was handed the captaincy when Mithali Raj was rested for the limited-overs series against Bangladesh, making it clear that she is the one in waiting for the job. In November 2016, she replaced Raj as captain of the T20 team for the series against West Indies. ESPNcricinfo staff View more"

To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.  Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs. He was a genuine threat to Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI and 51 Test hundreds. An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him.

The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations.There haven't been too many bowlers of his ilk in India, and Kuldeep, therefore, attracted immediate attention after successful stints at the Under-19 level.Kuldeep played his first India U-19 game in April 2012 as a 17-year old and and despite consistently taking wickets, he stayed below the radar.  It was the 2014 edition of the U-19 World Cup in Dubai that pushed his stocks higher. After a wicketless spell in the opening game against Pakistan, Kuldeep picked up a hat-trick in the next game against Scotland. ""As Kuldeep, mere ko wicket nikaalna hai (As Kuldeep, I knew I had to take wickets),"" he said after the match.He gained in stature in the games that followed, repeatedly troubling batsmen with his turn and finished with 14 wickets, the joint second-highest in the tournament. The performance seemed to justify why Kolkata Knight Riders' scouts had forked out $66,000 for him in the IPL auction prior to the Under-19 World Cup.Kuldeep had been part of the Mumbai Indians set-up in the 2012 season where he had a fond memory of bamboozling Sachin Tendulkar once in the nets with his wrong'un. That did not translate into an IPL debut. Nor did it happen with Knight Riders in the 2014 season. He had to wait until the Champions League where, playing as a support bowler to Sunil Narine, he impressed with his economy. Following those performances, he was included in India's ODI squad for the series against West Indies in October 2014, and he made his first-class and List A debuts shortly after.Having established himself in the Uttar Pradesh and India A sides, Kuldeep made his Test debut against Australia in a deciding match in Dharamsala in March 2017 and claimed 4 for 68 in the first innings.ESPNcricinfo staffView more"

No wonder then that once thrown the new SG ball, Bhuvneshwar can make it hoop around corners, mostly back into the right-hand batsman but he gets it to hold its line often enough to be a genuine threat. Like the other Kumar, though, Bhuvneshwar operates at a middling pace of early 130s, but India weren't spoilt enough for choices to deny him an international debut season at the age of 22, in late 2012.Bhuvneshwar said a roaring hello to international cricket. In his first international over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash of a four-Test series. Apart from the swing, Bhuvneshwar's control of it and his cricketing smartness stand out. It stood out the time when he, as a 19-year-old, worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first first-class duck in Indian domestic cricket. The cricketing smartness showed with the bat too when he scored 128 batting at No. 8, winning a Duleep Trophy semi-final in 2012-13, just before his selection for India. Bhuvneshwar was one of the lone bright spots in an otherwise wretched tour of England, taking 19 wickets at 26.63, an Indian record for most wickets against England in a Test series. He was dragged down by injury in Australia and played only one game in the 2015 World Cup.

It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new. There were plenty of frustrating times as well. Shami was hopeful of a return to the Indian team in early 2016, but a hamstring injury ruled him out a limited-overs tour of Australia and the Asia Cup in February. He was selected in a 15-man squad for the World T20 in March, but was unable to break into the XI having spent a year out of international cricket. Shami hails from Uttar Pradesh, but plays first-class cricket for Bengal from where he was noticed. He had played only 15 first-class and 15 List A games when he was drafted into India's ODI team to play Pakistan in Delhi in January 2013. He showed the faith wasn't misplaced and returned figures of 9-4-23-1 in a 10-run win, thus becoming only the eighth bowler, and the first Indian, to bowl four or more maiden overs on his ODI debut. His Test debut, which happened in November that year against the touring West Indies, was even more spectacular. He reverse-swung the old ball appreciably,  and at good pace, in the two-match series to take 11 wickets at 16.54. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs against England in Nottingham. Shami's quick promotion to international cricket was the result of impressive performances in the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy: in five matches he took 28 wickets at 21.35, including two ten-wicket hauls, against Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad. He has also enjoyed early success in the Twenty20 format, picking up 14 wickets in his first eight domestic Twenty20 games, and was signed by Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2011 IPL season. He got his first game for them in 2013, and was acquired by Delhi Daredevils in 2014, who retained him in 2016 despite his missing the entire 2015 season with injury. ESPNcricinfo staffView more"

The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand. Sturdy and athletic, Siraj has a deceptive run-up, which initially suggests that a left-arm bowler is steaming in. He is, however, a right-armer and by his own admission is a natural at getting the ball to swing into the right-hander. He has always been able to bowl a pretty quick bouncer though, something that had impressed his captain David Warner and team mentor VVS Laxman in the Sunrisers Hyderabad set-up. Potential translated to performance when he was his state's highest wicket-taker playing only his second season of Ranji Trophy - 41 wickets in nine matches. He was subsequently picked to play for the Rest of India and was brought on board by the India A team as well for a tour of South Africa in July-August 2017. The step up to the big league arrived soon after.

He finished as the leading run-getter, for Baroda, with 377 runs in 10 innings at an average of 53.85. Pandya also took 10 wickets and was instrumental in Baroda making the final. He was subsequently called up for India's limited-overs tour to Australia, where he made his international debut, before impressing with the ball on the seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. Pandya appeared to be the answer to India's search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly fielding complementing his main skill-sets, he sealed his spot in India's 2016 World T20 squad. While Pandya batted only twice in the tournament, he had a lot more to do with the ball. He bowled the last over against Bangladesh and defended two runs off three balls to help India to a one-run win. A little more than a week after his heroics, Pandya endured the disappointment of bowling a no ball to reprieve Lendl Simmons, whose unbeaten innings helped West Indies clinch the semi-final.ESPNcricinfo staffView more"

His Test debut likewise came about when Jadeja was forced to sit out the 2021 England series with a broken thumb. Axar took five wickets on debut in the second Test in Chennai, and followed it up with an 11-wicket haul in the third: he finished the series with 27 wickets.

After taking 23 wickets at an impressive average of 11 in the 2008-09 Under-19 Vinoo Mankad Trophy, Harshal made his List-A debut for Gujarat in 2008-09. Harshal also played for India in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand and soon bagged an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians.Unable to find a place in the Gujarat side, Harshal moved to Haryana and made an immediate impact in his debut Ranji Trophy season in 2011-12, running through Karnataka and Rajasthan with eight-fors in the quarter-final and semi-final. He finished that Ranji season with 28 wickets and made his IPL debut for Royal Challengers Bangalore against Delhi Daredevils in the 2012 edition. Harshal, however, was largely seen as a back-up seamer in the franchise set-up, instead of a first-choice option. He did not get a game in IPL 2013, but was bought back by the franchise in the 2014 player auction. While his first-class form dipped in between, he made a strong comeback in the 2015-16 season. His tally of 22 wickets in Ranji Trophy 2015-16 added to a haul of 13 wickets in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, in which he also picked up his maiden List A five-for. He was retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the IPL 2016 player auction.After fighting through a period of self-doubts, Harshal roared back by picking up 52 wickets in nine matches at the 2019-20 Ranji Trophy, breaking left-arm spinner Rajinder Goel's 36-year-old record for the most wickets in a season for Haryana.But it was in the the 50-over Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy that season where his all-round prowess came to the fore. He picked up 19 wickets at an economy of 7.04, the joint second-most that season, just one behind stopper R Sai Kishore. He also contributed massively with the bat, making 374 runs at an average of 31.16 and a strike rate of 165.48.Ahead of IPL 2021, he was traded to Royal Challengers Bangalore after a brief stint with Delhi Capitals. It turned out to be a breakthrough year, where he finished with 32 wickets, the joint-most in an IPL season with Dwayne Bravo. His mastery over the dipping yorker and several slower variations earned him plaudits. The performances were enough to impress the national selectors, and a T20I debut followed against the touring New Zealand side in November 2020. In February 2021, Harshal was bought for a mind-boggling INR 10.75 crore (USD 1.4 million) by Royal Challengers. It was 53.75 times his previous IPL salary.ESPNcricinfo staff

In an era of counterattacking batsmen, Pujara is a rare successful defensive batsman who takes pleasure in grinding down attacks and then feasting on them. He steps down to spinners but keeps the ball along the carpet, he doesn't tire of scoring runs no matter the opposition or venue, his fitness is more about what is required for batting for long periods as opposed to bulging biceps with tattoos on them.Son and pupil of former Ranji player Arvind, Pujara grew up piling on big scores even as a boy: a triple-century in Under-14 cricket, and a double against England in Under-19. Yet for years and years Pujara's first-class runs were scoffed at: he played for cricketing backwaters Saurashtra, and Rajkot, his hometown, is known for one of the flattest tracks in India. Pujara worked harder than most to be taken seriously, and his chance in Tests came in his sixth year in first-class cricket, behind contemporaries who had made a name through limited-overs cricket. Pujara grabbed the chance when it arrived: after getting out to a shooter in his first Test innings, he came in ahead of Rahul Dravid at No. 3 and waltzed his way to an excellent 72 in a tricky chase against Australia in Bangalore in October 2010. He soon became the joint-fastest Indian to 1000 Test runs. When he scored his next domestic triple, people were not scoffing anymore. The ride wasn't easy: a knee operation all but ended his limited-overs career, and he kept getting dropped from the Test side for flashier batsmen until he proved his value to a Test line-up with a show with immaculate defensive batting in India's historic first series win in Australia in 2018-19. He faced 1258 balls in the series, the highest for a visiting batsman who played four Tests in a series in Australia, and scored three centuries to bat Australia's bowling into submission.

Only 11 players have scored 1000 runs in a single Ranji season, and that puts his effort in perspective. Rahane's progression to the Mumbai Ranji team was a natural one - he had represented them at all age levels, and was always seen as a prospective Mumbai player if not more. His bumper Ranji season followed an impressive showing in the 2007-08 Duleep Trophy, where he scored 172 against an England Lions attack that comprised Graham Onions, Monty Panesar, Steve Kirby and Liam Plunkett. That innings came after followers of Mumbai cricket had started to write him off as a a fine talent but fit only to make a swift 50. Two years later, he had shown they were way off.He continued to churn out the runs in domestic cricket, hitting three hundreds each in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons of the Ranji Trophy. Two centuries in the Emerging Players Tournament in Australia brought him a place in the India ODI squad for the tour of England in 2011. After months of sitting on the bench and travelling with the Test squad, Rahane got his debut in Delhi in March 2013. In only his third Test, Rahane scored fifties in each innings in Durban before making his maiden Test century against New Zealand in the drawn Test in Wellington. Rahane then was at the forefront of India's first win in Lords after 28 years, setting the game up with a solid 103 in the first innings. He followed it up with his maiden ODI century at Edgbaston as India wrapped up the series.Rahane continued his impressive form in Australia, scoring fifties in Adelaide and Brisbane, before striking 147 in Melbourne, establishing himself as a vital cog in the batting department. Rahane was a key part of another first; his 79 helping India to their first win over South Africa in a World Cup match.View more"

Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.Rahul attracted plenty of attention at the subsequent IPL auction, and finally went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 1 crore (US$ 166,000 approx.). He was a regular member of their side in the 2014 season, mostly as wicketkeeper-batsman, but his contributions with the bat were steady rather than spectacular.In the long format, however, his technique and application have impressed some of Indian cricket's most respected names. These include Rahul Dravid, with whom Rahul shares not just a name but also a strong rapport, regularly seeking him out for technical and mental advice.Rahul had a middling tour of Australia with the India A team in July-August 2014, getting starts each time he batted in the unofficial Tests but only managing a top score of 52. But his appetite for runs was back to normal by the time the 2014-15 domestic season began, and twin centuries in the Duleep Trophy final earned him a place in India's Test squad on their tour of Australia.A profitable IPL in 2016 set him up to make the Indian ODI and T20 squad that toured Zimbabwe in June, where he became the first batsman from his country to score a century on debut in 50-over cricket.Karthik Krishnaswamy

The woman with most runs in the game, and the only Indian captain - male or female - to have led the side to two 50-over World Cup finals, the only major distinction that eludes the incumbent ODI captain is the tag of a World Cup winner. In pursuit of that dream, Raj bowed out of T20Is in September 2019, as India's highest run-scorer, having last led the side in the format during the 2016 T20 World Cup at home.At 16, Raj scored an unbeaten 114 on ODI debut and soon established herself as the lynchpin of India's batting. The roots of her copybook stroke play lay in her precocious talent that blossomed under the tutelage of her former coach, the late Sampath Kumar, and a regimented upbringing in an army family. With a passion for Bharatanatyam, her nifty footwork found expression on the field, becoming as much a hallmark of her batting as have been grace and an unrivalled precision at plundering runs in the cover region.Her technical soundness and ability to anchor an innings at the top of the order in all three formats have inspired two generations of India batsmen. Both those skills underpinned her highest Test score of 214, in 2002, and later an unbeaten 91 in the 2005 ODI World Cup semi-final, a knock she rates at par with her double-century.During the 2017 ODI World Cup, Raj surpassed former England captain Charlotte Edwards to become the highest run-scorer in ODIs and the first woman to 6000 runs in the format. Her 409-run tally in the tournament was second only to England opener Tammy Beaumont's, while her three fifties and a century were vital to India's runners-up finish.In the 2018 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, Raj found herself embroiled in a controversy in the wake of her omission from the semi-final. She accused then head coach Ramesh Powar of unfair and discriminatory behaviour and expressed her disappointment over T20I captain Harmanpreet Kaur's decision to support her exclusion.In October 2019, Raj, at 36, became the first woman to complete two decades in ODI cricket.

He grabbed the chance with both hands, becoming the 15th Bengal player to score a hundred on Ranji debut. Though he managed only one more fifty in the remaining first-class games of the season, he was signed up by the Kolkata Knight Riders for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League. He managed 318 runs in five games in the 2009-10 Ranji season and was picked in the squad for the first Test for the home series against South Africa. A last-minute injury to Rohit Sharma handed Saha an unexpected debut in Nagpur - as a batsman.His second Test appearance - against Australia in Adelaide in January 2012 - was also somewhat accidental, a result of MS Dhoni's suspension due to a slow over rate. In between, Saha played two ODIs against New Zealand, but has mostly been seen as India's reserve wicketkeeper on overseas tours.  Dhoni's retirement from Test cricket after the Boxing Day Test against Australia in Melbourne in 2014 opened the doors for Saha, who had long been an understudy, to firm up his position in the team.Cricinfo staff May 2014View more"

A Rajasthan Royals mainstay, he has made over 3000 runs for them in the course of his first eight seasons.Samson moved to Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala in his early teens after taking his first cricket lessons in Delhi, where his father worked as a police constable. In Kerala, he created waves on the junior circuit with his batting, showing impressive technique and an ability to time the ball crisply. He made it to the India side for the Under-19 Asia Cup in 2011 but did not impress in the tournament, and missed out on selection for India's U-19 World Cup side the following year. Rajasthan Royals bought Samson at the IPL auction in 2013, when he was 18, and save for the two years when the side was out of the league for a ban, he has been a fixture in their line-up. He was appointed captain in 2021, when he made 484 runs, kicking off with a barnstorming 119 off 63 balls in their tournament opener, against Punjab Kings, followed by three 40s in a row later in the season, and then an unbeaten 70 and 82 in back-to-back games. His fine, consistent displays did not reflect in Royals' finishes on the tournament's points table, which continued to be disappointing up until 2022, when they were second (Samson made 458 runs that year).He made his first-class debut in 2011-12, and impressed with bat and as keeper for Kerala in the Ranji Trophy. In 2013-14 he finished with 530 runs at an average of just under 60, including a double-hundred in his first game; that was followed by 475 runs the next season. In 2015-16, he was 20 when he was appointed captain of the Kerala side. In October 2019, in a showcase of his by then formidable white-ball skills, Samson made 212 not out, the highest score in the history of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the time, for Kerala against Goa.A call-up to the India T20 side came in July 2015, and he made his debut against Zimbabwe in Harare, but then went four and a half years before his next game in the format for India. He made his ODI debut in 2021, which was followed a gap again, of a year before he played his next ODI - in a series in the West Indies, where he made 54 in the second match.

Standing at 6'4"", his rhythmic, high-arm action allowed him to bowl at around 140 kph. For one who started serious cricket at 14, his rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18. An injury to Munaf Patel provided him an opening during India's tour of Bangladesh in May 2007 but it was in Australia where he caught the attention, prompting Steve Waugh to call him the next best thing in Indian cricket. He showed he could move the ball both ways and his probing spell in the second innings in Perth, where he set-up Ricky Ponting, is the stuff of folklore. He continued to impress in the one-day series, clocking more than 150kph once, and ended as India's highest wicket-taker in the triumphant campaign. The glory days continued through his debut season, with a notable performance against South Africa, followed by 15 wickets in four Tests in the succesful home series against Australia in 2008, and a couple of strong shows in Sri Lanka in ODIs. By now Ishant was clearly Zaheer Khan's deputy in the Indian seam arsenal, but things have gone seriously wrong since. Some have blamed it on his being over-bowled, particularly on flat tracks in the IPL, while others point to a malaise that has afflicted all of India's new crop of fast bowlers. The fact remains that Ishant lost the most crucial aspect of his bowling - his pace. Without it, his natural short-of-a-good-length that had tormented batsmen of Ponting's calibre a season earlier lost its venom. Eventually the loss of pace led to a loss of self-confidence. The Indian selectors decided to be careful and began shielding him from the shorter formats of the game in 2009 in the hope that he would rediscover his zip. His struggle continued but given India's limited seam-bowling resources at the time, Ishant was persisted with, even after an ankle surgery in 2012 that put him out of action for months. When he completed 50 Tests in early 2013 he had among the worst averages for bowlers with 50 Test caps to their name.Since then Ishant has somewhat revived his Test career. He was impressive on the tour of New Zealand, being the top wicket-taker in Tests with 15 wickets that included two five-wicket hauls. On his next overseas assignment, in England, Ishant was the hero of India's famous win at Lord's when he bounced out the England batsmen with his spell of 7 for 74, helping India to a 1-0 lead in the Test series. It was perhaps one of his best performances for India in whites.  He soon suffered a leg injury and was ruled out for the following two Tests. He did return for the fifth Test but his 4 for 96 was only part of an embarrassing innings defeat for India. He then went back to Australia, the country that had kick-started his career, but he could only manage mediocre performances in the three Tests he was a part of. His landing foot was proving to be a constant irritant to his fitness and the fast bowler picked up another injury, this time to his knee and was ruled out of the ODI tri-series that followed. Ishant failed to recover in time for the World Cup and was replaced by Mohit Sharma.Siddhartha VaidyanathanView more"

It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word ""talent"" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won five IPLs in the first 12 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double. Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him ""Hitman"" when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter. But Rohit still became known as one of the foremost hitters of colossal sixes of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a massive score every time he went past 50.His captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to four titles, won plaudits. He proved himself a methodical, studious and calm leader, one not averse to using technology and data to arrive at decisions. He was an able deputy to Virat Kohli in limited-overs formats in international cricket, winning India two titles in Kohli's absence, and took over as captain in all formats in 2022.

He made his first-class debut before that, for Punjab in the Ranji Trophy in late 2017 with a half-century in the game and an attacking 129 in the next match.A constant feature in Rahul Dravid's plans for the Under-19 World Cup, Gill constantly played at an age-group level above his. In 2014, he smacked 351 in Punjab's Inter-District Under-16 tournament, and shared a record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh. On his Under-16 state debut for Punjab, he made an unbeaten double-century in the Vijay Merchant Trophy. Later that year, he went on to share the stage with his idol Virat Kohli while receiving a BCCI award for the best junior cricketer, which he won for two successive years: 2013-14 and 2014-15.When picked for the national Under-19 side, he amassed 351 runs in four innings to be named the Man of the Series during the Youth ODI series at home against England. In the reciprocal tour, his first in English conditions, he top-scored once more, with 278 runs in four innings. India swept both series.
While he was still in New Zealand for the World Cup on the day of the 2018 IPL auction, Gill was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 281,000 approx).View more"

With the new ball, Thakur's at-the-batsman method forms a neat counterpoint to Dhawal Kulkarni's more metronomic style, and the two combined brilliantly to win Mumbai their 41st Ranji Trophy title in February 2016. Thakur picked up eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match.Thakur hails from Palghar, a town 87 km north of Mumbai, and spent his early cricketing years lugging his kitbag on early-morning trains into the city. Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy in his debut season of 2012-13, but he did not play a major role in the triumph, picking up only four wickets in four matches at an average of 82.Told to lose weight by his Mumbai team-mates, Thakur came back leaner and fitter the next season, and picked up 27 wickets at 26.25. The 2014-15 season was even better, Thakur finishing joint-top of the Ranji Trophy bowling charts with 48 wickets at 20.81. That earned him a call-up to the India A squad for four-day games against Australia A and South Africa A. Later that year, playing for the Board President's XI, he bagged a four-wicket haul against the touring South Africans, his wickets including those of Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla.Kings XI Punjab signed Thakur for INR 20 lakhs at the 2014 IPL player auction, but he only got to play one match in his first two seasons for the team.ESPNcricinfo staff

He made his debut for India at 24, by which time he was averaging nearly 60 in first-class cricket and it was the knowledge of what it takes to score big runs that helped Vihari become a first-choice pick within months of his introduction to Test cricket. He emerged as the best batsman on both sides during a 2-0 victory over West Indies in 2019, with 289 runs in four innings. At the end of that series, India's captain Virat Kohli said the dressing room always feels calm when they see Vihari batting out in the middle because he was so correct in his approach. Some of that was hard to see when he made his debut against England at The Oval in 2018. He could have been out for a duck had Stuart Broad decided to use DRS but he didn't and Vihari put that nervy start behind him to compile a half-century in his first Test innings.He then opened the innings against Australia in Melbourne as a make-shift option, and though he didn't get big runs, he showed staying power. His relative failure as an opener was - rightly - not held against him, and he earned his middle order spot back on India's next Test tour, to the West Indies, where he got into the XI ahead of Rohit Sharma, a move that was surprising at the time but eventually also series-winning.Vihari began his career with Hyderabad in 2010, but then shifted to neighbouring Andhra in 2016. While he was making consistent runs in domestic cricket each season, his first India A call-up happened only in 2017. At one point it looked like he might be one of several talented Indian batsmen who would have to make do with great domestic careers. Part of Unmukt Chand's World Cup-winning Under-19 team in 2012, Vihari saw several team-mates gain more prominence in the next few years. Even with India A, success was not immediate, but Vihari was fortunate that his rise coincided with MSK Prasad being the chief of selectors. The former India and Andhra wicketkeeper had had the opportunity to observe Vihari closely, and knew he was quality. Vihari would repay the faith with performances against South Africa A and New Zealand A, and then with the Indian team.Saurabh SomaniView more"

His best Ranji season came in 2014-15, when he topped Haryana's bowlers with 33 wickets. He began the season with a six-for and went on to take 13 wickets in a match against Saurashtra in Rajkot.

That tally included a double-century against Orissa in his third match of the season, and a hundred in the next. He capped the season with yet another hundred, in the Duleep Trophy. After a blip in 2012-13, he was back among the runs the next season, where he finished among Mumbai's top three run-getters.Yadav spent four seasons with Kolkata Knight Riders, starting in their second IPL title-winning year, 2014, though with 684 runs from 60 games he didn't quite provide a foretaste of what he would go on to do with Mumbai Indians in the years that followed.

What makes his ascent even more remarkable is that he represents unglamorous Vidarbha in the Plate League of the Ranji Trophy. Yadav is the son of a coal-mine worker and was aiming to become a policeman. He only started considering a career in cricket as a 19-year-old, an age by which the best young Indian cricketers are in the running for a national cap. As a fast bowler, he has many skills: he regularly bowls at over 140kph, moves the ball both ways, and has a pretty effective bouncer. These qualities helped him take 20 wickets at 14.60 in four games for Vidarbha in his debut season in 2008-09. While he made waves in the domestic scene, Umesh really caught the eye during IPL 2010, where he impressed a much wider audience with his pace for Delhi Daredevils. He finally broke into the big league, when he was flown to the West Indies as a replacement for the injured Praveen Kumar during the World Twenty20 tournament in May 2010, and earned his first call-up to the India Test team for the tour of South Africa in November the same year. He made the Test playing XI for the first time against West Indies in Delhi in November 2011, and picked up nine wickets in his first two Tests, which in turn earned him a place for the Australia tour. On that tour, a disastrous one for India, Umesh was one of few positives for the side, outbowling his more experienced team-mates to finish with 14 wickets from four Tests and a strike rate of 50.50. More than his figures though, it was his speed and aggression that stood out. However, 2012 was an injury-prone year for him: he picked up a shin injury in Australia, before being ruled out one Test into the England series at the end of the year with back trouble. He returned to international cricket in June 2013 at the Champions Trophy in England, and a fast-bowler starved India would have heaved a collective sigh of relief to notice he had not lost his ability to bowl quick.After continuing in the ODI circuit, both home and abroad, Umesh was picked for the Australia Tests in 2014 and he followed that up by becoming one of India's frontline bowlers at the 2015 World Cup, finishing as the third-highest wicket-taker with 18 wickets at an average of 17.83.Siddarth RavindranView more"
