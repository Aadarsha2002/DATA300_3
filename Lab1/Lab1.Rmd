This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

```{r load-tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r test}
#plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r reading_csv}
gss <- read_csv("Lab1/gss2014.csv")
head(gss)
```

```{r check-class-age}
class(gss$age)
```

```{r check-class-year}
class(gss$year)
```

```{r check-class-childs}
class(gss$childs)
```

```{r check-class-zodiac}
class(gss$zodiac)
```

```{r create-variable}
gss$can_drink <- if_else(gss$age >= 21, 1, 0)
gss
```

``` {r gss2-try-pipeling}
gss2 <- gss %>% filter(age < 21)
gss2
```

``` {r gss2-multiple-operations}
gss2 <- gss2 %>% select(age, zodiac) %>% arrange(age)
gss2
```
